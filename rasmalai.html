        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Ras Malai is a popular Pakistani delicacy made with milk,a curdling agent,sugar, nuts, saffron and cardamoms</p>
        <h3>Ingridients</h3>
        <h4>For the Rasmalai Balls</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 liter whole milk</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon cornflour</li>
            <li>4 cups water</li>
            <li>1 cup sugar</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>For the syrup</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>500 ml whole milk</li>
 <li>5-6 green cardamom pods peeled and crushed to get the powder</li>
 <li>saffron a pinch</li>
 <li>4 tablespoons sugar</li>
 <li>finely chopped pistachios</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Boil milk in a heavy bottom pan.Once it comes to a boil, switch off the flame and add 1/2 cup of water to bring the temperature of the milk down a bit.</li>

 <li>Wait for 5-10 minutes and then start adding lemon juice till milk curdles.</li>

 <li>Add lemon juice till the milk curdles completely.</li>

 <li>Using a strainer drain the water and collect the chena.</li>

 <li>Rinse it under tap water so that there's no trace of lemon juice in it.</li>

 <li>Leave it in the strainer for 10-15 minutes and then take the chena in your hand and squeeze out remaining water slowly.</li>

 <li>Add cornflour and start mashing the chena till it’s smooth.</li>

 <li>Set the clock to 10 minutes and mash constantly for 10 minutes using your palm. Once it’s smooth, make small balls out of it.</li>

 <li>Heat 1 cup sugar and 4 cups water in a wide pan and wait till it comes to a full boil. Drop the balls in boiling sugar syrup and cook for 15-17 minutes. The balls will double in size by then.</li>

<li>Take out the balls from the syrup and drop them in fresh water. If they sink to the bottom, the balls are done. They are always done by 15-17 minutes so you can skip this step if you want.In a heavy bottom pan, boil 500 ml of milk.</li>

<li>Soak few strands of saffron in a tablespoon of warm milk and set aside.</li>

<li>Once the milk comes to a boil, lower the flame and continue to stir the milk at regular intervals. After 10 minutes add sugar and mix.</li>

<li>After 20-25 minutes the milk will thicken to desired consistency, add soaked saffron and crushed cardamom.</li>

<li>Also add finely chopped pistachios [if using]. Mix and switch off the flame.</li>

<li>Take out the cooled down rasmalai balls from the fresh water bowl. Squeeze and flatten lightly using your hands and put in sugar syrup for around 10-15 minutes [so that they absorb the sugar] before transferring them to milk. Squeeze the balls carefully as they are very soft and can break easily. I like to flatten the rasmalai at this stage rather than flattening them in the beginning. I feel they get cooked evenly in the sugar syrup when the balls are round in shape.</li>

<li>Transfer the balls to thickened milk [milk should be warm].
Chill in the refrigerator overnight or for 5-6 hours. Garnish with chopped pistachios and few saffron strands before serving.</li>
